			** Exception and irq forwarding **

In exAmour, the exceptions and irqs are forwarded to a user handler
as soon as possible and when the user env specified one.
However some exceptions are critical and then take advantage of a
special treatment.

Fault and abort exceptions that can be handled by a user env
are forwarded and if none has been specified, they are handled
by the kernel.
An example of that kind of exception is the general protection
fault on intel architecture.

Fault and abort exceptions that cannot be handled by a user env
are directly handled by the kernel.
An example of that kind of exception is the double fault on intel
architecture which can lead to a reboot of the machine if not
handled correctly.

Exception and irq forwarding flow chart:

 event (exception or interruption)	kernel				user env
      | the kernel is signaled of an
      | event in the execution flow
      |--------------------------------->|
					 | after saving the
				         | critical informations
					 | of the env, the handler
					 | is called
					 |--------------------------------->|
									    |
					   once handled, control is returned|
					   back to the kernel		    |
					 |<---------------------------------|
	kernel ack the handling and	 |
	continue normal execution flow   |
      |<---------------------------------|

In case of no user env handler, kernel env handler is called.
