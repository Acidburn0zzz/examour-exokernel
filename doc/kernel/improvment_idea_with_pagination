		** Improvment idea with pagination **

This idea doesn't aim to improve the velocity and probably not
the security of the system but it should not decrease the security so
maybe it is not so bad.

The point is to use the multisegmented model as planned and to add the pagination.
The pagination is one 4gb flat address space for every environment so the problem
we currently have with gcc can be delayed.

Advantages of the pagination :
 - easier environment programmation with common compiler
 - ease dynamic library management

Disadvantages of the pagination with multi segmentation :
 - slower because the multi segmentation still remains and we have two chain of checks instead of one
 - use of several segments (gdt and ldt) harder so one of the advantages of the segmentation
   is lost.

On the other hand, the multisegmentation is kept and the pagination mapping is let to userspace
which let the processor level controls to remove the risk of exploiting overflows.
