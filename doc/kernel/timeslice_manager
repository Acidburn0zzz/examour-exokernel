			** exAmour's timeslice manager **

The timeslice manager is the kernel env's subcomponent responsible
of the environments scheduling.
It is a flexible way that allow exAmour to defer scheduling policies
to userspace on a per env basis.

@ How to use:
	The ability to request a timeslice do not depends on the
	env'permission map.
	We consider this ability like breathing for humans.

	The timeslice manager userspace API is as follow:

		bool	timeslice_add(unsigned int amount);

	where amount is expressed in timer ticks and must evolved
	sooner to be expressed in milliseconds.

	At creation time, every env is granted by 100 units.
	After, it is up to the env to request by himself for its
	timeslices.

	One important thing is that events forwarded to userspace
	are timeslices consuming. If no time remains, nothing
	will be forwarded.


@ Env scheduling flow chart:

 Env			  	  Kernel		Env's kernel mapping
  |
  | check the remaining time in its private kernel mapping
  |------------------------------------------------------->|
  |							   |
  | The total cputime is returned			   |
  |<-------------------------------------------------------|
  |
  | Too little cpu time remains
  | the env requests more through
  | sys_timeslice_add()
  |------------------------------->|
  |				   |
  | The kernel updates the cputime |
  | allocated for the env          |
  |<-------------------------------|
