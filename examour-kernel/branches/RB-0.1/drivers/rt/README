			** Notes about language specific runtimes **

Languages runtime are object files that are expected to be linked against every application
compiled for the ExAmour platform.
A language runtime object file provides a basic set of functionalities that are recognized to be
useful for all applications.
In ExAmour, a language runtime provides the following functionalities in a language specific fashion:

 - syscalls wrappers;
 - prologue/epilogue upcall control;
 - other upcalls control;
 - memory mapped information control functions;
 - entry point/exit point functions;
 - // TODO others will be added as event and env support will evolve.

UPDATE: August, 29th 2007.
	The rt is no longer needed for C language. Please use libos/libc/klibc/ instead.
