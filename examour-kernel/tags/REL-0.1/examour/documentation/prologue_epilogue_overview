			** exAmour's prologue/epilogue **

The prologue and the epilogue is a way to defer non critical process
context saving and restoring to the userspace.
It is intended to provide a greater efficiency, flexibility and to
speedup the context switch process.

In exAmour, both the prologue and the epilogue are optionnal.
Indeed, the kernel automatically saves the segment selector registers
and the general purpose registers, therefore, a process which need a
prologue and an epilogue will typically need either to modify the
values the latter or to save/restore other informations.

It is important to note that during a prologue/epilogue, the env is
executed with its segment selectors and its allocated stack0.
