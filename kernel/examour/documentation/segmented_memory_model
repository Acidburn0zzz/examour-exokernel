			** exAmour's segmented memory model **

exAmour is a kernel which largely relies on the userspace env to
manage the resources.
The memory segments are included and therefore the present document
only expose the forwared kernel information of the segmented model.

It is important to note that general and readonly kernel informations
are GDT segments (please see gdt_layout for further informations)
while per env informations and write access informations are in the
LDT of each env.

@ The LDT:
Each env in exAmour has to allocate an LDT, even if the env do not
intend to use segmented memory model.
An LDT is created during _init_memory_map (see env_manager and
first_env_launching) through the sys_ldt_create() syscall.

By default, the two first entries of the ldt are statically allocated by
the kernel.
 - LDT[0] is the ldt itself.
 - LDT[1] is the kernel part of the running environnement.
   It is actually the env's kernel stack which contains all the
   env's kernel mapping.
Both are read only data mapping.

@ The GDT
Data common to everybody in the system are mapped in the gdt at
GDT_SEG_UEXPORTED index.
Those data are read only mapping and provides every env general purpose
informations about the kernel state and stat, the hardware, the drivers, ...
But no informations about the running envs since our privacy contract is
very strict on this point.
