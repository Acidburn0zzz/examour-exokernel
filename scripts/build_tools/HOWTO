		** How to use the devel environment **


Prerequisites:
 - grub 0.95 or later
 - mtools
 - bximage
 - bochs >= 2.2.6

In order to use the devel environment you first need to set it up.
This is done by using the following script:

 #./install.sh

A floppy drive will be created.

Then to commit and try the result of your devels you just have to use
copy files in the osdev/ directory and launch qemu.

If you hack on the kernel, you can use:
 #./launch.sh qemu
to copy the freshly (or not) compiled kernel in the osdev directory
and try to run it using qemu.

bochs is also possible by issuing the following command:
 #./launch.sh bochs
 or
 #./launch

Enjoy.
